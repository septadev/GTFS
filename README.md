# GTFS

This is SEPTA's General Transit Feed Specification publication for rail and bus service. This is a primary source intended for transit and mapping applications.

## Latest release
 
Latest version: [20201205](https://github.com/septadev/GTFS/releases/tag/v202012071) updated on December 3th, 2020, effective on December 5th.  This combines two different rail GTFS into one file.

* December 7th Rail - [20201207](https://github.com/septadev/GTFS/releases/tag/v202012070)
